Metrics in practice are usually described using natural languages, typically in ‘plain English’, which is often difficult to understand, compare, and implement. Such definitions of metrics lead to many problems. Typical concerns include:\n","Processing line: — Clarity: The metric definition may be incomplete, ambiguous, illogical, self-contradictory, or not defined at all. For example, cases exist where ‘availability’ is defined in ways which have little to do with generally accepted definitions of ‘availability’; where the definition is such that the service can be unavailable for the majority of the time yet the metric will show 100 % availability; where the metric requires continuous monitoring, which is actually not possible; or where the provider is able to determine at its sole discretion what the result is.\n"," Matched availability: {}\n"," No 'value' group found for match: availability’ is defined in ways which have little to do with generally accepted definitions of ‘availability’; where the definition is such that the service can be unavailable for the majority of the time yet the metric will show 100 %\n","Processing line: — Comparability: It may be impractical or effectively impossible to compare different services in terms of their promised service levels because of the significant inconsistency in how their respective metrics and SLOs/SQOs are defined.\n","Processing line: — Implementation: It may be impractical or even impossible to measure the metric in practice, and to determine whether promised service levels have been met or not.\n","Processing line: This document has been developed to help address these and similar concerns.
